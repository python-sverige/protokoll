# Minutes of Meeting
* Venue
  - Contracted received after negotiations. Contract is in-line with our estimates. 
  - The full amount should be variable because maybe not all ticket will be sold.
  - Helio volunteered to use his credit card as guarantee, close to the date of the conference.
* Video technician
  - Got quotation, price is 80k for 2 days (last year it was 50k for 2 days).
* Keynote Speakers
  - Keynote speakers should not be invited on a first-come first-served basis. 
  - A better practise is to update the spreadsheet and discuss internally which persons we want to invite. 
* Tickets
  - Event created at eventbrite
  - Ticket prices adjusted accorded to the costs in the spreadsheet
