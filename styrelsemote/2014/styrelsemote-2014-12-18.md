### Closing the books
We have not received any invoice from KTH, and might have to close our books for the year without it.

### Venue
We are blocked on many other points until we have decided what venue to choose. We should get inquires into all proposed venues until next week.
* We will try to get as many offers as possible from different venues until the 22nd (Monday).
* We will calculate final ticket price - assuming 200 attendees - and compare prices for each venue by the 23rd (Tuesday).

A quick calculation of costs for one of the suggested venues landed on a ticket price of roughly 2000 kr, suggesting we need more sponsorship than last year.

### Announcement
Martin will create at discussion thread at Ginger for coordinating the annoucement of Pycon 2015.
Initial annoucement will be sent out on the 5th of January (Monday). This is to avoid the annoucement getting drowned out in holiday emails during christmas.
We should allow talk proposals as soon as possible. Preferably an announcement should be made calling for talks on Wednesday the same week. (2015-01-08)
26th January will be the deadline for announcing the conference date.

### Sponsorship
Fredrik will create a spreadsheet for organizing sponsor outreach, and link it to Ginger.
We will need to talk about what different sponsorship levels to offer.

### Finances
Fredrik will add a Ginger thread to discuss the current state of finances.
Next meeting we will assign someone to be responsible for our banking state.
