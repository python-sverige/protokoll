speakers have confirmed and we will chase the few that haven't.

We reviewed the ticket sales. They are going well and as expected.

## Sponsoring

We have signed extra sponsors and got material from them to add to the
website.

## Liquidity, Bank & Budget (Nicolas)

We're still trying to fix the bank access and it should be done by the
8th of April.

The budget looks good and as expected. We should break even in the
worst case scenario.

We will double check with Hilton that we only have to pay for the food
for the final attendees and when we need to give them the final list
