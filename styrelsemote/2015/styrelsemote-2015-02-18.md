## Last meeting's minutes

Meeting last week did not reach quorum, so no decisions were made.

Fredrik H recounted discussion and went through minutes for the meeting week before last.

## Bank access

Nicolas not attending, no update here. Fredrik H will follow up directly with Nicolas.

## Budget

Discussion about layout of budget spreadsheet.

Assumed distribution in budget of personal vs. corporate tickets seem close to actual result last year (113 corporate and 57 personal sold).

All attendees asked to review and add any items that seem to be missing for review next week.

## Program and Speakers

30 proposals have been submitted, with a quality level that seems good enough for a two day program.

Ana will put together a draft schedule for two days with two tracks.

We need to review all proposals, and will use same process as last year which is a simplified version of PyCon's process.

Fredrik H will add a review tab to CFP spreadsheet and explain process on Ginger. We need to review all proposals ASAP to be able to confirm speakers and announce schedule.

Ana will submit PR to remove the CFP from www.pycon.se and close the Google form for further submission.

Kate Heddleston found a sponsor for travel, so we have a second keynote speaker! Ana will post on Ginger with details.

Two keynote speakers considered good enough. One opening keynote per day will make sure people arrive in the morning and that people don't leave in the middle of closing keynotes.

## Sponsorship

We need to sign with sponsors who said yes, and contact more sponsors.

Python Academy's proposal was discussed and it was decided to be OK if they go for at least a silver level sponsorship. They will organize everything around their training themselves and instead of a booth will get some promotion of their training on website etc.


Dan will apply for a PSF grant for PyCon Sweden this week.

## Venue

Full payment to Hilton is required on **April 11** so we need to start ticket sales and get sponsors to pay before this date.

Jyrkki will ask Hilton for discounts on hotel rooms to use when opening ticket sales.

## Marketing

Next push will be opening ticket sales and/or announcing keynotes.

## Ticket sales

We need to decide on ticket price levels, which we cannot do until we know more about sponsorship levels. Decision postponed until next week at which point we must decide on ticket prices and start sales. Contact more sponsors!

## Other questions

Invoice from KTH for last year's venue should have arrived. Fredrik H will check mailbox and update on Ginger.
