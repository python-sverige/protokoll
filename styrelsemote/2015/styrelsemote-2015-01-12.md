## Sponsorships
We  will use the sponsorship levels proposed last meeting:

[Djangocon 2015](http://2015.djangocon.eu/sponsorship/) has good ideas for sponsorship rewards, which we will adapt.

Jyrki will write down the specific benefits we choose, and add a sponsorship page to the homepage.

## Venue
We have signed on with Hilton Slussen for the 12-13th of May.
Tome will update the official Twitter page and homepage with this information, and link to Hiltons webpage from our homepage.

## Marketing
Martin will create a thread on Ginger to coordinate sending the announcement email calling for talk proposals. The annoucement will be sent to these recipients (among others):

* our previous talk proposal applicants
* our mailing lists
* the official python conferences mailing list

It's time to start hunting for keynote speakers. Fredrik will try to ask Ian Oswald. Fredrik will ask Ana to create a discussion page on Ginger for suggestions of good keynote speakers.

## Other questions
Tome will grant the rest of the pycon.se board permissions to acces the google apps account files.

Tome will create a document where we can create a general overview for the work to come.

We should apply for a card from Swedbank to be able to pay for Google Apps and the domain fee.

## Next meeting
Fredrik will create a recurring calandar event and invite the other board members.
