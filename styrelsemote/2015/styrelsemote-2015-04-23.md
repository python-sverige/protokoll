### Last meeting's minutes

Fredrik reviewed last meeting's minutes.

### Program and speakers

Five speakers have not yet registered for the conference on Eventbrite.

Schedule is done, needs to be published on the website.

- **AH** will remind speakers who haven't yet registered to do so
- **AH** will post pull request for schedule

### Ticket sales

Sales are going well, only a few tickets left of personal and student tickets, and ~20 business tickets left.

### Sponsorship

Some sponsors haven't paid yet, but most invoices expire April 27, so they still have some time to go.

### Liquidity, bank & budget

Liquidity situation looks good, however we need to pay the second half of the Hilton invoice before end of April
and are currently lacking about 20k in cash on the bank account to cover it.

Before the Hilton due date is here, we should see some more sponsor payments come in, otherwise we will be able
to cover it by transferring money from Paypal.

Bank situation is still unchanged, Swedbank did not accept our updated paperwork.

- **FH** will visit Swedbank in person when he is back in Stockholm to clear up confusion

#### Recording

We received an estimate for recording that totaled ~49k.

Assuming no further ticket sales and no other costs, we would still make a ~64k profit after paying for that recording.

However, since the estimate did not seem to include any post-recording editing, we felt it was fairly high.

Decision on whether or not to accept was postponed until next meeting so we can get some more proposals.

- **TC** to request second estimate from alternative vendor for recording and editing

### Marketing

We will ask speakers to write blog posts about their topics to be posted after the conference ends. Good way to keep the blog and Twitter accounts etc. alive until next year.

### Other questions

A small company asked if they could distribute stickers etc. at the conference. It was decided that the minimum commitment
necessary to distribute material like that is a bronze-level sponsorship.

If you are reading email in the info@pycon.se inbox, please archive email that has been fully handled, and star any email that needs more attention.

Only 5 people had registered as Staff in Eventbrite - we need a complete list of people attending by next week to confirm food etc.

- **everyone** attending the conference should register in Eventbrite

### Next meeting

Tuesday April 28, 20:00 Swedish time
