### Program and Speakers:

We are still waiting on 2 speakers.

### Ticket Sales

We have sold out all tickets. They are 250 in total.

We can fit 285 people as long as we don't order more than 250 meals from Hilton. So we can accept more people from the waiting list. 

Nicolas will check the waiting list and accept a few more attendees.

### Liquidity, Bank & Budget

Most sponsors seem to have paid.

Current budget draft indicates that we will make a ~74 000 SEK profit.

### Volunteers

We will also write down a contact list of the volunteers.

We will create a Ginger discussion regarding the location of a meeting with all volunteers and staff can attend.

Nicolas will confirm that we will use Hiltons recording solution.

We will publish conference talks on youtube.
