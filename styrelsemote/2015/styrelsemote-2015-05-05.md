### Last meetings minutes

FH reviewed

### Program and speakers

Everyone has confirmed, only one speaker hasn't bought a ticket (Kenneth).
### Ticket sales

140 business tickets, 20 more than expected!

266 tickets sold total.

Only missing ticket is a speaker, we will print a ticket for him anyway.

### Sponsoring

No new sponsors.

PSF grant does not seem to have been come in - we need to confirm if this is actually being paid.

Actions:
- **NL**: Will review bank statement to see which sponsors have paid

### Liquidity, Bank & Budget

#### Budget

59k profit according to budget, with paying for refreshments and recording.

We are assuming PSF grant does not come in until we confirm they are paying. If it does, we do almost 90k in profit.

Liquidity looks good, we should be able to pay our bills.

#### Keynote expenses

We decide not to pay travel expenses for keynotes, but cover their tickets.

#### Fika

We decide to accept Hilton's offer of 60 kr per person and day for fika.

- **FH** will confirm that this also includes water etc.

#### Drink tickets

We will order 270 drink tickets, so we can give to students as well.

We only need to pay for the tickets that end up being used, so our max exposure is 270 x 90 kr = 24 300 kr
if everyone orders a glass of wine, which we assume won't be the case.

- **FH** will ask Hilton for 270 drink tickets

### Marketing

#### Recording

- **FH** will ask Hilton if they can help out handling the recording company that refuses to invoice us

### Volunteers

We have a total of 11 volunteers, one of them dropped out.

#### Responsibilities / instructions / cheat sheet

- **FH** will post a draft document and post to Ginger

#### Meeting

Looks like Fredrik H, Nicolas and Jyrki can make it to the Hilton meeting. Tome might be able to make it as well.

### Next meeting

No board meeting until the conference unless necessary to make a decision. Will schedule another board meeting after the conference.
