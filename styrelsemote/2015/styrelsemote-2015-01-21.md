### Present

- Ana Hristova
- Martin Melin
- Nicolas Lara

### Program and Speakers

We want to shoot for two keynotes this year: one opening and one closing keynote. This will make it easier to recruit high-quality speakers. However if we get three very good keynote speakers we may adapt accordingly.

**Ian Oswald** is interested. Fredrik will contact him and offer him one of our slots.

**Jessica McKellar** is a great lead for keynote. Ana will contact her and check her interest level.

Call for proposals has lead to slow response, only two proposals sent in as of yet. Everyone should try to push the CFP in their own social channels as much as possible.

### Budget

Nicolas is creating a budget spreadsheet outlining costs and ticket prices, sponsorship levels necessary. We will try to take "early bird" pricing into account in ticket prices.

### Sponsors

Jyrki is setting up a page listing benefits to sponsors.

Everyone should try to contact at least one company off of the sponsor list before the next meeting.

### Venue

Hilton has been signed, there is not much left to do here.

### Marketing

We need to market the conference and the CFP more.

Fredrik is posting to the pysthlm list and the user groups in Stockholm and Gothenburg

Jyrki is posting to the Helsinki user group

Ana is posting the conference on lanyrd.com

Post new ideas for marketing the conference on Ginger!

### Other questions

#### Volunteers

We should start working on volunteers earlier this year. Fredrik will look through past minutes and post a thread on Ginger about coordinating volunteers.

#### High-level responsibility list

Fredrik is posting spreadsheet listing high-level areas of responsibility.

#### Recording

Nicolas will ask Hilton for a quote on recording talks during the conference.

#### Email

Everyone should help out monitoring the info@pycon.se email inbox. If a question is easy to answer, answer right away. Otherwise post to Ginger thread and get sign-off from majority of board.

### Next meeting

Next meeting set up for Wednesday January 28.
