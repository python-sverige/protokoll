## Last meeting's minutes

FH reviewed last meeting's minutes.

## Marketing

We messed up this week's planned keynote reveal. We had the PR for a website update, but no Buffer posts scheduled
so we ended up not revealing our first keynote speaker on Tuesday as planned.

If you accept responsibility for an action point, it's OK to realize you won't have time and tell someone else
(at least FH) so that the action is taken. But you do need to tell someone else that you won't have time to do it.

We will reveal first keynote tomorrow morning Swedish time.

Actions:
- **FH** will schedule Buffer posts announcing first speaker
- **FH** will merge the PR for the website before the Buffer posts go out so website is updated
- **MM** will review the PR
- **AH** will submit new PR for next keynote reveal

## Budget

No major changes since last meeting.

If we can sign one gold sponsor and a couple of silver sponsors, we will hit our "Low Sponsorship" scenario, which is important.

For sponsors we have a personal relationship with, we should ask them to pay early so we have the liquidity to pay the venue.

## Program and speakers

21 talks have not received any -1, meaning no reviewer would fight against having the talk included.

We will accept all of these talks, and offer longer slots to talks that have gotten one or more +1s.

Actions:
- **AH** organizes sending out acceptance emails to these 21 speakers and asking for confirmation 
- **AH** will post discussion to Ginger on draft schedule

## Sponsoring

No major changes since last meeting. Keep contacting companies!

Softhouse is confirmed silver-level sponsor.

Fyndiq has expressed interest in gold-level sponsorship but not confirmed yet.

## Venue

No update, we need to know if we have gotten a quote from Hilton.

## Ticket sales

At time of meeting, we have sold a total of 23 tickets via Eventbrite. Considered OK for this point in time.

- 12 business
- 9 personal
- 2 student

total of ~30k income.

## Next meeting

Since very few people attended today, we will discuss alternate times on Ginger for next meeting, but tentatively Wednesday same time as today.


Actions:
- **FH** to start discussion on Ginger on new meeting time
