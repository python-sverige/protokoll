4. 2017 conference
   - Because we are getting a late start, we are targeting a September 2017 date for PyCon SE rather than May
   - Most important right now is to get a few sponsors on board, since our cash on hand is very low
   - We will attempt to sign on sponsors without having a firm date for the conference, since we assume we will need to pre-pay to reserve a venue and do not have the cash to do so yet
   - For the next board meeting, we will discuss and decide on further details of the conference, such as:
     - What kind of conference? Traditional, "unconference", etc.?
     - Single track or multi track?
     - How many days?
     - How many attendees?
     - A few target dates in September 2017
     - Budget, how much to cover from sponsors vs. ticket sales
     - Ticket pricing, raising the ticket price?
   - For the above discussion, Martin will circulate a summary of the feedback responses from 2016
   - Andrey will reach out to Ingenjorshuset to better understand their policies regarding booking - would it be possible for us to reserve the venue without pre-payment?
