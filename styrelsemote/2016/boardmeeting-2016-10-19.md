6. Type of conference:
     We discussed what kind of conference we want to arrange. A number of different options were discussed.
     
     We decided to have a focus on open source projects and include time in the conference for attendees to hack on those projects.
     
     The idea is to invite speakers who represent open source Python projects, where they will start by giving an overview
     of their project and some practical advice on how to get started in the project.
     
     Attendees can listen to a few different talks from different projects and decide which project they want to spend the
     "hack time" working on.
     
     Attendees can be encouraged to team up and we should take care to make sure there is a good mix of types of issues
     to work on so that every level of skill and familiarity with Python can find something interesting to contribute.
     
     The idea is really to have PyCon Sweden 2017 be a great time to be introduced to a new open source Python project, potentially
     making your first open source contribution.
7. Sponsors:
    We need to start contacting sponsors. We should first

    - Contact sponsors from prior years
    - Make a list of open source projects that are affiliated with a company that could also sponsor
    - Publish the concept on the site
8. Venue update:
    Andrey heard back from Ingenj√∂rshuset, they are willing to host us without pre-payment. Payment terms are to pay within 20 days of the conference ending.
9. Cadence of meetings:
    We decided to have board meetings every two weeks.
