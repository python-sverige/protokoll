# Minutes of Meeting

## Updates

### Swagg
- Swagg will be the same as last year
- Lanyards will be in different colors to accommodate for people who don't want to be taken photo of
- On Monday we need to send badges. Nikita will prepare the data for badges generation

### Social event
- Bishop's arms don't have space for 70 people.
- Simron contacted a few other bars and there is a bar that does invoices and can accommodate 300 people. They want a
  meeting on Sunday. Their offer is similar to Bishop's arms. Our estimate is 70-200 people. It's also close to the
  venue.
- We'll make 100sek tickets for the social event
- Need to negotiate a flexibility for the payment for the conf and mb some cheaper beer for the conf guests.
- Will make a decision about the place next week.

### Venue
- There is an option to have tables and chairs in the conference room. We need to decide on arrangement.
- Will put tables in the back and some along the wall with coffee
- We need 4 tables for sponsors

### Ticket sales
- Seem good. Will probably finish with around 250 people
- Made late bird tickets for the last 10 days before the conference

### Sponsors
- There is a chance that pyladies will have a table
- We'll decide on Wednesday whether to have the tables with the coffee brake area

### Budget
- We are considering boosting us on the social media.
- Will discuss a challenge for participants to make a post on social media and giveaway for participation on slack.
- All info is up to date on the balance spreadsheet.
